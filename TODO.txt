----------------------------
TODO for version 0.4.1
* Bugs: one instance of an invalid GEZJob (because I disconnect while submitting) not deleted
* drag-and-drop files from the Finder
* copy contents from the tables in the GUI
* allow to remove xgrid jobs
* Add an icon for "Retrieving" status for the jobs
* Add a "clean" button for metajob: remove all memory of previous submissions, same for individual commands in the "Info" panel

----------------------------

OTHER BUGS/FEATURES

* have a 'default' metaJob, editable when no MetaJob is displayed. To do it, I could have the default metaJob in the store, and subclass NSArrayController and add one of NSPlaceholder methods. Well, I tried, it is not that easy... I may have to go to the user defaults. OK --> create a dictionary in the user defaults. If it does not exist, do not use it (!). A selected job can be used to 'Set Default Settings' in the menu or with a button

* when creating a new meta job, could check that it does not use an output folder shared with another metajob. In fact, it could work fine (if the same thread probably!).

* clicking "Load Demo" deletes all the stuff that another job is potentially using

* run the job submission and retrieval in a different thread if too much spinning wheel...
