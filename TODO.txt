----------------------------
TODO for version 0.3
* continuous save of the store (?)
* submit to several grids, take available agents into account
* detect when a MetaJob is finished --> stop the timer and update statusString (and revert when changing some of the settings)
* refactor to better separate GridStuffer model and views, and to separate it from the app delegate --> ultimately a framework
 --> this means I will also need a separate class to play the role of the application delegate in the framework, e.g. class 'GridStufferInterface'
* entity names need also a suffix, like class names, if GridStuffer is going to be a framework..
* really honor maxBytesPerSubmission in MetaJob submissions
* the data source of a metajob should not have any idea of indexes, but just 'nextTask'. Or maybe leave the possibility for two types of data source, one called with indexes and one called using 'nextTask'.
* use a delegate with XGSServer
* more comments in the class headers
* Application Support folder: use a hierarchical structure instead of just different names for different versions/debug
* Persistent store: there might be several different stores in use by different apps or the same app

----------------------------

OTHER BUGS/FEATURES

* have a 'default' metaJob, editable when no MetaJob is displayed. To do it, I could have the default metaJob in the store, and subclass NSArrayController and add one of NSPlaceholder methods. Well, I tried, it is not that easy... I may have to go to the user defaults. OK --> create a dictionary in the user defaults. If it does not exist, do not use it (!). A selected job can be used to 'Set Default Settings' in the menu or with a button

* when creating a new meta job, could check that it does not use an output folder shared with another metajob. In fact, it could work fine (if the same thread probably!).

* clicking "Load Demo" deletes all the stuff that another job is potentially using

* maybe the submission timer in meta jobs could be triggered only when needed --> in other words, use notifications rather than polling for job submissions

* run the job submission and retrieval in a different thread if too much spinning wheel...
